# Rather than connecting your EC2 instance or EBS volume directly to GitHub, the recommended approach would be to:

# Set up a CI/CD pipeline using either:

# GitHub Actions

# AWS CodeDeploy

# AWS CodePipeline




# Using AWS CodeDeploy:

# Create an IAM role for your EC2 instance with CodeDeploy permissions [2]

# Install the CodeDeploy agent on your EC2 instance [3]

# Create an appspec.yml in your repository:

# version: 0.0
# os: linux
# files:
#   - source: /
#     destination: /app
# hooks:
#   AfterInstall:
#     - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
#       timeout: 300
#       runas: root
#   ApplicationStart:
#     - location: scripts/start_application.sh
#       timeout: 300
#       runas: root




# The key reasons to use a CI/CD pipeline instead of direct connection:

# Security: Proper credential management and access control

# Reliability: Automated, consistent deployments

# Rollback capability: Easy to revert problematic deployments

# Testing: Ability to run tests before deployment

# Audit trail: Track who deployed what and when

# If you're looking for a quick development setup, you could:

# Set up a deployment user with limited permissions

# Use environment variables for sensitive data

# Create a deployment script that pulls from your repository

# Use process managers like PM2 to handle application restarts

# Remember: Never store credentials in your code or repository. Always use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive information.
